## Phase 0 — Foundation Hardening (Current State Cleanup)
> Fix known issues in the existing prototype before building on top.

### 0.1 Post-Route Buffer Insertion Fix
- [ ] Debug overlap caused by buffer insertion after routing
- [ ] Re-enable `LogicOptimizer` buffer insertion with legalization pass
- [ ] Validate no DRC violations introduced

### 0.2 STA Backward Propagation (Required Time)
- [x] Implement required-time (RAT) backward traversal — topological sort, reverse pass
- [x] Compute actual slack = RAT − arrival time per pin (written back to Pin objects)
- [x] Add WNS, TNS, violation count — `Timer::getWNS()`, `getTNS()`, `getViolationCount()`
- [x] Validate: shift_reg signs off clean at 1 GHz (WNS=734ps, 0 violations)

### 0.3 Routing Robustness
- [ ] Fix pin access point computation (currently assumes pin center is always valid)
- [ ] Add escape routing for macro pin congestion
- [x] Validate convergence on designs > 500 cells (bench_500: 511 cells, 88s)

### 0.4 Error Handling & Logging  **[~] Partial**
- [x] Structured logger with INFO/WARN/ERROR levels (`include/util/Logger.h`)
- [x] CTS "clock not found" demoted from ERROR to INFO for combinational designs
- [x] `load_pdk`: throws `RuntimeError` on missing Liberty/LEF files; validates cell count after parse
- [x] `load_verilog`: throws `RuntimeError` (instead of silent print) on parse failure
- [ ] Add graceful failure modes for unroutable designs and missing nets
- [ ] Return meaningful error messages through FastAPI (HTTP 422/500)

### 0.5 Regression Test Suite  **[~] Partial**
- [x] Baseline tests for `full_adder`, `shift_reg`, `adder` — 29/29 passing
- [x] Assert: placement legal, routing converges, GDSII non-empty, SPEF written
- [x] STA sign-off checks: WNS finite, TNS ≤ 0, 0 violations at 1 GHz
- [x] GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): build + all tests on push/PR
- [x] `run_all_tests.py` — single-command runner; exit 1 if any suite fails
- [ ] Add `soc_sram` benchmark (macro floorplan test)

---

## Phase 1 — Scalable Core Algorithms

- [x] Scale validated: bench_200 (207 cells, HPWL=2168), bench_500 (511 cells) — 13/13 pass
- [ ] Benchmark on 100K cell design (needs structural Verilog at that scale)

### 1.2 Global Routing  **[x] COMPLETE (2026-04-24)**

- [x] Generational searchId/netUsedId replace std::set — O(1) ownership checks, zero heap churn
- [x] Adaptive grid scaling (MAX_GRID_NODES=300K), dynamic bounding box, MAX_EXPAND=60K cap
- [x] Fix negative congCost bug (pin usage -50 + PDN obstacles → parentIdx cycles → bad_alloc)
- [ ] Refactor A* to operate within global route guide bounding boxes
- [ ] Add track assignment stage before maze routing
- [ ] Multi-threading: per-GCell parallel routing (replace per-net)
- [ ] Memory: replace flat 3D grid with sparse octree/hash map for large dies

### 1.4 Hierarchical / Incremental Flows

## Prioritized Quick Wins (Start Here)

These unblock the most downstream work for the least effort:

| Priority | Task | Why It Unblocks |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | STA backward propagation (RAT + slack) | Timing closure, ECO, SDC all need slack |
| 2 | SDC constraint parsing | Without it, timing closure is impossible |
| 3 | SkyWater 130nm PDK integration | Real tapeouts, real validation, no NDA |
| 4 | Regression test suite | Prevents regressions as code grows |
| 5 | Structured logger | Debugging at scale requires it |
| 6 | Analytical placement | SA doesn't scale past 10K cells |
| 7 | Global routing stage | Detailed router can't scale without it |
| 8 | TCL scripting interface | Every EDA user expects it |
